Basic Elasticsearch and Kibana setup using Docker.

Follow these steps:
1) Run the "docker-compose.yaml" file up and you should be ready to go!

2) Browse to "http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:5601" to access Kibana.

NOTE:
You can change the network mode from host to bridge. Just edit the "docker-compose.yaml" file and add the proper route to Kibana.
